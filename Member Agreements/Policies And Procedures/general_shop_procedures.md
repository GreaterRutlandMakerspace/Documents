Be aware of others' activities around you. You must ensure that you are safe before you an area or begin your work.

## Personal Protective Equipment

Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) is required for all equipment and tool use. You may bring your own PPE, and the Makerspace may provide certain PPE for you to use, but **it is always your responsibility to ensure that you know, have, and use, the proper PPE for the activity you are undertaking, and for the activities around you.** If the proper PPE for a certain tool or piece of equipment is unavailable, for any reason, you may not use that tool or piece of equipment. 

Notify Makerspace staff if any PPE provided by the Makerspace is missing or damaged.

## Training & Certification

Training & certification is required for certain equipment. **Do not use equipment if you are not trained, certified and comfortable with it.** If you do not know if a piece of equipment requires training & certification you may not use it. Due to the cost of consumables, the time and expertise required, or other reasons, some training & certification may be offered in the form of a class for which there may be an additional charge.

## Safe & Proper Use

The operation of machinery is at your own risk. **It is your responsibility to know how to use all tools and equipment properly and safely, and to do so.** If a tool or piece of equipment does not require Makerspace training & certification, but you do not know how to use it properly and safely, you may not use it. Always ask for help from a volunteer, another member or staff.

## Broken, Damaged or Unsafe Equipment

Do not use broken, damaged or unsafe equipment, or equipment that is marked as such with a note, a lockout, or another method. If you find that anything is broken, damaged or unsafe you must report it to the staff. If a staff person is not immediately available, affix a note to the item and leave it behind the welcome desk. If it is large or immobile, affix a note to the item and leave a note at the welcome desk.

## Consumables

The Makerspace will provide some consumable items such as drill bits, mills, inserts, saw blades and abrasives. Even with care and proper use these items eventually break or wear out. Bring these broken and worn items to the welcome desk.

The Makerspace cannot guarantee that any particular item will be available at a given time.

Members using an unreasonable amount of these consumables, breaking them through improper use, or wearing them out through heavy use, may be asked to provide their own, provide replacements, or charged for their cost.

## Materials

The Makerspace generally does not provide materials. Any materials made available to members are subject to reasonable use, availability, and are provided "as-is."
