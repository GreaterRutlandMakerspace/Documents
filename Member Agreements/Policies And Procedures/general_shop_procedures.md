## Shared Saftey

Please stay on the lookout for unsafe behavior and approach and offer feedback to fellow members if you believe they are working unsafely. Please notify staff immediately if you believe any piece of equipment to be unsafe.

Be aware of other people around you. You must ensure that they are safe before you begin or continue an activity.

Be aware of others' activities around you. You may have to don PPE or wait until it is safe to enter an area.

## Personal Protective Equipment

Proper protective equipment (PPE) is required for all equipment and tool use. You may use your own PPE, and the Makerspace may provide certain PPE for you to use, but **it is always your responsibility to ensure that you have, and use, the proper PPE for the activity you are undertaking, and for the activities around you.** If the proper PPE for a certain tool or piece of equipment is unavailable, for any reason, you may not use that tool or piece of equipment. If PPE provided by the Makerspace is missing or damaged you will notify the Makerspace.

## Training & Certification

Training & certification is required for certain equipment. **Do not use equipment if you are not trained, certified and comfortable with it.** If you do not know if a piece of equipment requires training & certification you may not use it. Due to the cost of consumables, the time and expertise required, or other reasons, some training & certification may be offered in the form of a class for which there may be an additional charge.

## Safe & Proper Use

The operation of machinery is at your own risk. **It is your responsibility to know how to use all tools and equipment properly and safely, and to do so.** Do not use equipment if you are not trained, certified and comfortable with that piece of equipment. If a tool or piece of equipment does not require Makerspace training & certification, but you do not know how to use it properly and safely, you may not use it. Always ask for help from a volunteer, another member or staff.

## Broken, Damaged or Unsafe Equipment

Do not use broken, damaged or unsafe equipment, or equipment that is marked as such with a note, a lockout, or any other method. If you find that anything is broken, damaged or unsafe you must report it to the staff. If a staff person is not immediately available, leave the item behind the welcome desk, or affix a note to the item if it is large or immobile, in addition to notifying the staff.

## Consumables

The Makerspace will provide some consumable items such as drill bits, mills, inserts, solder, saw blades and abrasives. Members may use a reasonable amount of these consumable items, and the Makerspace may require a you to provide your own consumables, or may charge you for the cost of consumables, depending on your usage.

Even with care and proper use some items may break or wear out. Bring these items to the welcome desk.

## Materials

The Makerspace generally does not provide materials. Any materials made available to members are subject to reasonable use, availability, and are provided "as-is."
