##Volunteer Addendum
This addendum applies only to members seeking to obtain a discounted rate by volunteering at the Greater Rutland Makerspace ("GRMS" from here forward).  This addendum must be included when the Volunteer Rate is chosen on the membership agreement.  This agreement applies in addition to the standard membership agreement, but both are in force.  Where there is a conflict, terms in the standard membership agreement supercede this agreement.
The member signing this agreement (hereafter the "Member") agrees to commit to at least 12 hours of volunteer time per month in order to maintain their volunteer rate.
If the Member does not complete at least 12 hours of volunteer time in any month, they will owe the difference in cost (an additional 50% of the selected membership tier) will be added to their account and due with the following month's payment.  
If the member fails to complete at least 12 hours of volunteer time for three consecutive months, they will be moved to the appropriate full cost membership tier at the next billing cycle.
If a member is moved to the full cost option due to failure to meet hours requirements, the Operations Committee must approve moving back to the volunteer tier, and reserves the right to elect not to do so for any reason, and without documented cause.
Volunteer members must attend and complete all mandatory trainings and training updates.  
Volunteer members must obey all rules, regulations and policies as outlined in the membership agreements, member policies, volunteer handbook and volunteer policies and procedures.
Volunteers may be removed from volunteer service if they fail to follow all the appropriate policies and procedures.
Questions about volunteer service should be directed to the GRMS volunteer coordinator.
