##Volunteer Addendum
This addendum applies only to members seeking to obtain a discounted rate by volunteering at the Greater Rutland Makerspace ("GRMS" from here forward).  This addendum must be included when the Volunteer Rate is chosen on the membership agreement.  This agreement applies in addition to the standard membership agreement, but both are in force.  Where there is a conflict, terms in the standard membership agreement supercede this agreement.

  a. If the member fails to complete at least 12 hours of volunteer time for three consecutive months, they will be moved to the appropriate full cost membership tier at the next billing cycle.
