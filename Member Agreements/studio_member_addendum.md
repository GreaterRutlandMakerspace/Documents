##Studio Member Addendum

The following terms and conditions apply solely to studio members or prospective studio members: 

* Upon signing this Membership Addendum, prospective studio members will be required to submit a $190 damage deposit. 

* All prospective studio members will be subject to a screening process to determine compatibility with GRMS's community goals and must complete a safety orientation before being permitted to use any studio space. GRMS will refund studio fees and the damage deposit to the prospective member if GRMS's staff ultimately determines that the prospective member will not be a good fit as a studio member. 

* Under no circumstances may a studio member attempt to sublet, assign or otherwise permit a third party to occupy any GRMS studio space. If an entity member undergoes a change in control (in which more than one-half of the interest in the entity is sold or transferred to a third party), the entity member must notify GRMS and request permission to continue use of the studio space, which may be granted in GRMS's sole discretion.
 
* Studio members seeking to modify the layout or function of the studio assigned for their use must obtain the written approval of the Executive Director, prior to making to such modification. As a general principle, assume that any changes that cannot be undone by the ordinary efforts of GRMS staff or volunteers using a broom, dustpan and mop in a single afternoon are changes that must be approved in advance. A studio member who modifies the layout or function of his, her or its assigned studio space in violation of this paragraph will be required to pay the costs of restoring the studio to its original condition. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Membership Addendum, the phrase "modify the layout or function" is to be construed in the broadest sense possible.
