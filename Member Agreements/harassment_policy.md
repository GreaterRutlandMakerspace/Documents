## HARASSMENT POLICY

The Greater Rutland Makerspace ("GRMS") is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of people at our events or space in any form.

All members are expected to be aware of federal safety and harassment free workplace guidelines, which are posted in the lounge area.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, and sexual images in public spaces as well as deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

People asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. People violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the space or the event at the discretion of any GRMS member. If you wish to report harassment anonymously or privately, you can fill out an incident form at the front desk or send a message to the executive director.

The first violation of this policy will result in a warning and temporary suspension of membership until the incident is resolved. A second violation will result in a suspension of membership until GRMS's Safety and Operations Committee has had the opportunity to meet with the offending member to resolve the issue. A third violation will result in permanent suspension from GRMS.
